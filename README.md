# Frodmir-project
A Telegram bot that analyzes the data by determining the genotype of both partners to compile the Pennet table.
# 📋 Description
This bot analyzes the genotypes of partners, combining them and calculating the likelihood of different genotypes appearing in the offspring. Using the Punnett table, the bot clearly demonstrates which genotypes can arise in the next generation and with what probability, making genetic calculations simple and accessible to everyone.
# 🔧 Functionality
- Genotype analysis: By entering the genotypes of partners, the bot calculates combinations of possible genotypes of children.
- Punnett table: The results are presented in a table showing the probability of occurrence of each genotype.
- Convenient interface: the bot works in the familiar Telegram interface, allowing you to get results directly in the chat.
# 🛠️ Technologies used
- Python is the main programming language.
- Aiogram is a library for developing Telegram bots.
- JSON - for storing and processing user data.
# 📈 Examples of use
When you enter the /survey command, you will need to take a survey to determine the genotype of both partners (for example, AA and Aa). It will then generate a Punnett table and display the probabilities of the possible genotypes in the offspring.
